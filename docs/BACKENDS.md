Cross-platform executable drivers for communication with ModbusTCP devices.
## Requirements
|Dependency|Description|Operation system|
|----------|-----------|----------------|
|cstdint   |Defines several fixed-width integer types, which are guaranteed to have the same size on any platform:	**int8_t, uint8_t**: 8-bit signed and unsigned integers. **int16_t, uint16_t**: 16-bit signed and unsigned integers.| Cross-platform|
|vector |It is a container that encapsulates dynamic size arrays. The elements are stored contiguously, one after another. This means that a pointer to an element of a vector may be passed to any function that expects a pointer to an element of an array.| Cross-platform |
